# Scenarios & Interactions for the Pre-Study

Regarding these ideas; there is no need to implement the exact image or text, we just need to have a placeholder that we can later adjust or replace.
To some extent, these are only building blocks. We can afterwards determine in which scenarios to put them exactly.

## Suspicion level indicators and visualisations
1. Progression of elements that changes with increased suspicion/confidence
   - A bar that is 85% full, indicating 85% likelihood that it is phishing.
   - A circle that is 30% filled, indicating 30% confidence that it is phishing.
2. Indicator/element that represents the confidence rating
   - An image of poison when it might be phishing
   - A question mark when it is questionable
   - A lock with a checkmark when it is safe
   - A traffic light system, where a light shines in green, yellow, or red.
3. When hovering over a link or attachment, display an overlay image or indicator
4. When clicking on a link or attachment, display some sort of interruption screen where you need to clock on "Ok" to continue with the link or attachment.

## Explainability Banners/Dashboards
5. A banner that is at the top of the email.
6. An underline below suspicious text to indicate that it is suspicious (like Grammarly).
7. A dashboard with several bullet points of text.
   - In one scenario, it opens when a user clicks an element, sort of like a dropdown menu.
   - In another scenario, the dashboard just instantly appears with the email.
   - In a third scenario, there is a "tell me more" button in the dashboard, which expands the dashboard with more text.
8. A visual dashboard, with indicators for suspiciousness in several areas.
9. Symbols near specific elements that indicate it is suspicious.

## interactivity/Chatbot/gamification
10. There is a button that opens a chatbot window. In other scenarios, the chatbot window is already open on the right side.
11. There is a chatbot window, where the chatbot just describes something to you.
12. There is a chatbot window, where the chatbot asks you some questions and you have to choose one answer from three boxes, twice.
    - Similar, but now there is a points tracker above the chatbot. If you click on the right thing, you get a point.
    - Similar, but this is now required; you cannot interact with the email until you clicked both right options. There are no points.

## Context/social interactions
13. There is a dashboard with some text that says x people reported this today.
14. The same dashboard says you have to wait 10 seconds, counting down. You cannot click any links/attachments until the 10 seconds are over.
15. There is some explanation above the email (so not just a banner, but distinctly outside the email) that provides some context (e.g., you're interacting with emails quickly, you just came back from vacation and are stressed, etc.)
